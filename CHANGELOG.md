# Changelog

All notable changes to OpenCami are documented here.
Format: [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) + [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [1.9.0] - 2026-02-21

### Added

- 🎨 **Artifacts Preview (Beta)** — Live HTML/SVG preview side panel. When AI generates HTML or SVG code, a "Preview" button appears in the code block toolbar. Click to open a sandboxed preview panel beside the chat. Enable via Settings → Workspace → "Artifacts Preview (Beta)".

## [1.8.2] - 2026-02-21

### Fixed

- 🔄 **SSE Streaming** — resolved session key mismatch that caused messages to get stuck on "generating" indefinitely. Stream now starts after `/api/send` response with the correct resolved session key, eliminating race condition on page load.
- 🛠️ **Tool Calls blocking stream** — `streamFinish` now correctly detects the last `assistant` message even when `toolResult` messages follow it, so the generating spinner always clears after tool use.
- ✨ **Follow-up suggestions** — fixed three separate issues: hook now triggers correctly after tool calls; `lastTextAssistantIndex` filters to `role === 'assistant'` only (not `toolResult`); server-side env keys (OpenAI, OpenRouter, Kilocode) used as fallback when no user key is configured.
- 🧹 **Inbound metadata stripping** — OpenClaw metadata prefix (`Conversation info (untrusted metadata): ...`) and timestamps are now stripped from all message rendering paths including chat bubbles, sidebar previews, and all message roles.
- 🔑 **LLM Settings UI** — all configured server-side keys (OpenAI, OpenRouter, Kilocode) now always shown with ✓ regardless of selected provider.
- 🚿 **Service Worker** — replaced with self-unregistering stub; old SW actively unregistered on page load to prevent SSE interception.
- 🔌 **Gateway connection** — stored in `globalThis` to survive Vite HMR reloads without reconnecting.

## [1.8.1] - 2026-02-19

### Enhanced

- 📊 **Dashboard System Stats** — added Load Average (1m/5m/15m), Uptime, Network I/O (RX/TX), Top 5 Processes by CPU, CPU model + core count. Progress bars now color-coded (green/amber/red by usage).
- 🕐 **Dashboard Cron Jobs** — now shows all cron jobs (scrollable list), includes enabled/disabled visual state, and displays total job count in widget header.

## [1.8.0] - 2026-02-19

### Added

- 📊 **Dashboard Panel (Beta)** — New `/dashboard` route with three live widgets: System Stats (CPU, RAM, Disk with progress bars), Gateway Status (active sessions), and Cron Overview (up to 6 jobs with next run time and last status). Auto-refreshes every 10 seconds. Enable via Settings → "Dashboard (Beta)" toggle.

## [1.7.0] - 2026-02-15

### Added

- 📎 **File Attachments** — Upload PDFs, text files, code, CSVs, JSON, and more via attach button or drag & drop. Files uploaded via HTTP to `/uploads/`, agent reads them with `read` tool. Images still use Base64 inline for vision.
- 📄 **File Cards** — Uploaded files render as clickable cards in messages showing filename, icon, and size. Click to open in File Explorer.
- 🖱️ **Drag & Drop** — Drop files onto the composer: images → Base64 (vision), other files → HTTP upload.

### Fixed

- 🧊 **Ice theme** — Always renders as light theme now, regardless of system dark mode setting. CSS media queries and JS theme logic hardened to prevent dark override.
- 📊 **File info endpoint** — `/api/files/info` returns correct file size via `fs.stat()`
- 🎯 **File card false positives** — Regex tightened to only match at start of message, ignores code blocks and quotes.

## [1.6.1] - 2026-02-15

### Fixed

- 🔐 **Gateway scope compatibility** — Request full operator scopes (`operator.read`, `operator.write`, `operator.admin`) for OpenClaw v2026.2.14 compatibility. Without this, sessions and models fail to load.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-02-13

### Added

- 🔧 **Workspace Settings** — Files, Memory, Agents, Skills & Cron toggles under dedicated "Workspace" section in Settings

- 🧠 **Memory Viewer** — `/memory` route to browse and edit MEMORY.md and daily memory files with grouped sidebar (Daily / Notes sections)
- 📂 **File Explorer toggle** — controllable via Settings (default: on)
- 🧠 **Memory Viewer toggle** — controllable via Settings (default: on)

### Changed

- File Explorer and Memory Viewer now have visibility toggles in Settings → Workspace
